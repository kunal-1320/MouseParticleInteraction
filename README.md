# Interactive Particle Simulation

This is an interactive particle simulation created using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript. The simulation allows users to adjust various parameters such as particle count, size, speed, repulsion radius, repulsion force, and return force to create different visual effects.

# Things to improve
1. To-and-fro Motion of particle after interaction (in star one) [FIXED]
# Update 
Added a third file (check it out)
## Note:- 
- Click two times in setting to open it
- 
## Features

- Adjustable particle count, size, speed, repulsion radius, repulsion force, and return force
- Smooth return of particles to their initial positions when not interacting with the mouse
- Repulsion of particles when the mouse cursor enters the repulsion radius
- Particles wrap around the screen edges
- Colorful 5-pointed star particles with a sub-color effect
- Now working for both mobile and Computers ( on swiping in mobiles)
- Also added some more settings in nodes simulation
- and many other things

## Usage

1. Open the `interactive-particle-simulation.html` file in a web browser.
2. Adjust the settings using the sliders in the top-left corner of the page.
3. Move the mouse cursor around the screen to interact with the particles.
4. Click on the settings button (or the cog icon) to show or hide the settings bar.
5. Click on the close button (or the times icon) inside the settings bar to hide the settings.

## Credits

This project was created by Kunal. The code was inspired by various particle simulation examples found online.
